# Comments from Elsbeth on web page


David Website suggestions for change:

Photo is squished (wrong editing mode when photo was adjusted)

at the summary nest to your photo:
‘Distinguished Researcher at Rethink Priorities Charity” or ‘Distinguished Researcher at rethink Priorities thinktank’. Now with the comma in between it looks like two separate positions.

Consider mentioning the research support that you are receiving from the GPI at the summary next to your photo

Consider placing a sentence about your academic past on top, something like: ‘After 14 years of academia at two UK universities I moved back to the united states and directed my focus to research and impact in non-academic environment.’

Red for links: change colour to more orange brown from jumper

Remove back slash in between alineas

text block under ‘My research and impact work…’:
- nonprofit should be non-profit

Under header ‘I published papers…’
- remove the three dots at the end
- change to ‘I publish papers’ as I think you intend to keep on publishing.

Under header ‘The new way’:
- remove ‘Elsevier&co’ and replace with something like ‘we can do better than paying the big academic publishers to produce static pdfs behind paywalls’
- rewrite the sentence ‘I’m working to research/write/gain-critical-feedback in…’ to a sentence with far less / , -

Consider putting projects that you want attention for higher up on this page, such as your innovations in fundraising project

Under the header’ Other projects and affiliations’:
Consider leaving this text out unless the bitterness that speaks from this sentence is something that you really want on your page!

General comment:

I love the idea of ‘The New Way’ and personally I would put that first and your traditional academic publications record after that
