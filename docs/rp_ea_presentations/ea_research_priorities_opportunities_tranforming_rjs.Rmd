# Preamble
## Message

![We can now do better than this vague hope!](https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-practical-men-who-believe-themselves-to-be-quite-exempt-from-any-intellectual-influence-john-maynard-keynes-39-75-16.jpg)

The founders of Effective Altruism took ideas from Philosophy, Economics, and other parts of academia to build a rigorous approach to 'doing the most good in the world', and to exploring and measuring this.

Miraculously, EA also has a passionate and influential group of supporters, and a substantial pool of funds for research, interventions, and advocacy!

EA and global priorities research offers a huge opportunity for academic researchers to have an positive impact (on the allocation of funds, and on the market of ideas).

There are opportunities for funding to support your research within academia, to promote the impact of your research (and gain valuable feedback), to help students find meaningful careers/research\
...and/or you may want to leave academia work directly for an EA-aligned organization (like I did).

## Introduction: Effective Altruism

## 'What is Effective Altruism?

![](images/ea_org_logos.png)

Doing the 'most good' given limited resources (some relationship to utilitarianism)... *but how do we define 'the most good'?*

-   Founders Pledge

-   Longview

-   Effective Giving

-   EA Funds

-   "Gates Foundation seems to do \~\$100M-500M/yr of grants in global economic development that seem to have cost-effectiveness on par with GiveWell work"

EAs are moving towards pursuing impact through their careers.

Since 2015 ["80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give long term"](https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/) (MacAskill)

There is also some support for politial influence, at least they say "the hour you spend voting is likely to be the most impactful one in your entire year on average... ...influence over how hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars are spent."

Things I care about: lining up with concepts in the discipline? But I really cared about ideas and impact.

![My research agenda c 2012](images/essex_research_venn.png) Essex, UK:

-   Experiments/trials and observational work on charitable and gift-giving: social influences, types of income/uncertainty

-   Applied microeconomic theory

![](images/iif_wiki.png)

Moved to Exeter, UK

-   to pursue 'Impact' (ESRC grant, REF focus)

-   Building teaching/research/outreach resources, such as

    -   [innovationsinfundraising.org](innovationsinfundraising.org) and ['barriers to effective giving'](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/index.html)
    -   "Researching and writing for Economics students"

---

![](images/exeter_crown.png) Positives: A fairly supportive environment, research freedom, many great colleagues, moderate teaching, targets 'deep and rigorous theoretical work', some of the smartest people

Limitations: academic politics and poor upper-management, countervailing rewards system, constant discussion of points/games (value drift), students

Standard publications as the only way to prove value; limits collaborative and nonstandard work

UK academia rewards either 'REF-points publications', box-ticking accreditations, or currying favor with 'admin'

![](images/rethink_priorities.png)

In 2021 I left my secure academic post:

> To pursue greater impact as a researcher at [Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/our-team), a think tank "dedicated to figuring out the best ways to make the world a better place." RP is closely tied to the Effective Altruism movement. My research into effective charitable giving is made possible by a grant from an individual donor under the advising of Longview Philanthropy.

> To build tools and programs promoting open, collaborative, and robust research, as well as teaching, learning, and research training outside of traditional university degree schemes.

**Defining a moral framework, considering 'what has value', and 'how to learn and choose'?**

... how to value things and be consistent, how to use uncertainty and information in making altruistic choices

E.g.,

-   moral weights

-   population ethics

-   moral uncertainty .

From GPI agenda:

> Under what conditions would a social planner or philanthropist prioritise policies that primarily increase social welfare in the far future rather than in the near term? For instance, under what condition would such agents prioritise saving for future generations (Ramsey 1928) or reducing the risk of human extinction (Baranzini and Bourguignon 1995)?

> Should one have the same levels of epistemic modesty about unusual moral views as one should about unusual empirical views?

> To what extent should we be risk averse in our approach to doing good, and what are the implications of reasonable risk aversion for global prioritisation? (Quiggin 1982; Buchak 2013; Greaves et al. MS)

> Social welfare criteria that are used to compare states that differ in population size typically specify a critical welfare level at which lives that are added to the population have zero contributive value to social welfare (Blackorby et al. 1995; Ng 1986; Broome 2004; Ch. 10). What kinds of lives have zero contributive value in this sense (Cockburn et al. 2014; Cowie 2017)?

**Empirical measurement informing the 'production function for good'**

-   'What has value and moral worth?' (e.g., sentience research)

-   How to measure value? (e.g., pain/pleasure DALY)

-   How to achieve value?
    - Direct interventions and policies, direct/indirect, short and LT impacts

- [Open Philanthropy grants](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/guide-for-grant-seekers): ramping up, very interested in funding research but "In general, we expect to identify most giving opportunities via proactive searching and networking"

## How can academics support and do EA/GP research within universities

-   Contact EA organisations; present your work

-   Help build open-content

Encourage your students

- to apply for GPI/FHI/RP fellowships and internships
- to engage with the [Effective Thesis Project](https://effectivethesis.org/project/)


### Who should want to work at an EA org? Why or why not?

Note: RP and GPI differ dramatically in focus and approach; I'm mainly talking about RP.

YES if you (because you like)...

-  Care about impact and social good; research outcomes, implications, applications

-  Rigorous analytical framework (Philosophy, Economics, Statistics/data) *anchored and connected to the practical*

-  "Interdisciplinary" in the right way

-  Positive, supportive environment: people motivated by *outcomes*, zero competitiveness/politics AFAIK

-  High-achieving, super-literate and 'switched on' colleagues

\

NO if you want to...

- Focus on deeply theoretical 'pure' research without a direct connection to impact

- Earn a lot of money, have the long-term job security of 'tenure'

\

MAYBE  if you want to...

- Teach/work with a large group of motivated young people, guide careers

- Publish in academic journals and the equivalent, present at academic conferences

- Prestige/public intellectual



## Which fields?

Economics: Both theory and empirical/application, development economics, behavioral, preference and choice theory, macrroeconomics, and more

Philosophy: The answers to 'arcane' philosophical questions are now driving  very important decisions and uses of funds

Psychology and behavioral science: "How to get people to care", "how to do messaging and how to measure the results"

Maths, statistics, computer science: AI-risk, data science, mathematics of uncertainty and forecasting, controlling technology, statistical experimental design...

Political science and international relations/area studies

Biology and neuroscience (RP just hired an entymologist): Wild animal welfare, animal sentience

Other sciences: Existential risks (natural and human)


EA impact success funding -- <https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/17702>

Marcus description for openphil that talks about 'how we think about this'

How to promote this

-   EA is trying to be empirically motivated

-   There is a lot of money your research can move

-   There is money to get the research done (e.g., FHI, Open Phil, CEA)

Other grants -- the swiss group 'negative utilitarians'; center for LT risk -- lots of funding not going through AI, Longview, Effective Giving, Founders Pledge

Openphil science budget is multi-million -- 50-60 million dollars per year, not including 40 million on AI



If you are working in animal science, development econ, public health, psychology -- giving and messaging

Human welfare: huge survey qaly and daly; neutral point on subjective well-being; Open Phil and others are willing to take the information and update it
