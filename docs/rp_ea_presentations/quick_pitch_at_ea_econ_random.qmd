\# Separate project: Infrastructure to support independent researchers

\## Persona interaction and motivation

Positive encouragement and feedback. Virtual spaces, focus-mate alternative , tap in

Collaborator matching -- Spencer Greenberg

. . .

(Aside: PA's supported by Kat Woods)

Tying simpler incentives to people's research -- intermediate incentives

\## Mentorship

trees -- 30 people have 1 mentor ... people with knowledge have little time. Only worth it if the disciples have a high probability of being mentors.

. . .

1\. Reading groups at the bottom, organizer finds someone who did an internship at an org, people at the top are mentored by gurus

2\. Top down ... find a few points at the top?

3\. Glue the reading to people 1 level reading up

\## Funding to right people -- Grantmakers don't have the time (or knowledge?) to judge

Small opportunities get overlooked

Independent researchers without strong pulbic track record, asymmetric information, experience good

Solution: Impact markets = prize contests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grantmakers offer broad prizes as well as specific ones

Independents sell a share of the potential to investors.. . .

Investors will be in the social circles of the funders.

. . .

Impact markets for XPrize and DARPA

Network with funders, bigger and bigger prize pools, test that the system works

\## Difficulties accessing paywalled publications,

Not a problem

\## Credibility and feedback on research ... paths to impact

Find problem, find solution, influence people.

. . .

Solution: People who are influential -- we set a system with webs of trust and pageranks

Prediction markets and reputation markets

Tie in with ResearchHub (coin based), Unjournal

"Attributed impact" adjusts to discourage 'ex-post successful but ex-ante hazardous' work
