# Reinstein: Notes on Sanjay Joshi appearance on Sogive podcast

Moves 1 million pounds/year? UK focus?

Sogive starts with most popular charities and evaluate

> cf givewell which tries to find 'only the best' and does not evaluate similar charities doing nearly as well

9:45 do people care how much their donation achieved?

Mixture of motivations when people are donating.

> (What evidence is he citing here?)

Divides impact into cost of intervention times benefit of intervention  13:20

Missing “invisible hand” (me — bc it’s a credence good and a status good etc.)

16:00 Charity leaders are motivated to fundraise to pay employees. Incentive is mainly to keep donors happy not beneficiary

17:23 covers overhead myth

Term “steel man”... the overhead idea

19:04. Considers the root of what people don’t like about overhead (psychologically)… Idea that they are being swindle or that the money is going to someone richer than themselves
… Charity CEO pay. ￼The competitive mindset. ￼For largest charities the CEO pay is usually no more than 0.3% of the? Revenue￼￼

> Note: I tend to believe self-stated motives when they are NOT flattering￼


26:29 Sogive approaches “ when we donate we are ￼buying outcomes for beneficiaries”￼. Samsung overhead is none of my business nor is a charity‘s￼￼  
I really like the framing of “make Stalin wrong”. I’d like to see that expanded a bit more but my friend in response to people who say how can you evaluate charity numbers when charity is such an emotional act and isn’t it good to do even some good)

Discussion of the two-part method evaluating charities.￼

> Can benefits as measured include spillovers and externalities?￼

> Estimated cost is not straightforward in my opinion because it is difficult to distinguish fixed costs, marginal costs, sunk costs et cetera￼

“The theory of change“

- In asking him about charity evaluation I would probably keep pressing him on the distinctions between their evaluations and those done by the other two main players (two of which have merged) impact matters and charity navigator￼￼


“Outputs and outcomes or charity sector jargon”

Sogive is going to do a survey of how people value outcomes.￼￼

> Isn’t it obvious that people would prefer to save a life and have 250 people go to an art gallery? Unless you were talking about people who will definitely never see art in their lifetimes.￼￼ Not a great example imho

> Considering the measurability question at first he started to talk about￼something to do with “a biased towards popularity” which made me think he was giving￼ A very different answer. When he saw the pivoted and kind of said that actually they are doing a lot to measure things people think are not measurable.
I would suggest that he might lead with “we are doing more to measure the hard to measure things then anyone else is doing“
