With the help of an undergraduate Frontrunner (Domenick), [I attempt to translate abstracts of my recent work](http://davidreinstein.wordpress.com/research-and-publications/popular-summaries-and-abstracts-of-recent-work/) from _academish economese_ into plain English. Lunchpail Joe, please let me know how well I am doing; this is a work in progress.
