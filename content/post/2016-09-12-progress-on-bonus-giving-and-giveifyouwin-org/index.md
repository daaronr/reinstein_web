It seems [our work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tR2V2nFZw69xomHMQNGSkDVgzOqRMtSKKHez-_u5zQU/pub) is  starting to have some traction. We worked with the Behavioural  Insights team and City Philanthropy in 2012 and they put out this ["Call for City firms to help Cabinet Office research into ‘windfall’ giving"](http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/news/call-city-firms-help-cabinet-office-research-%E2%80%98windfall%E2%80%99-giving) (link fixed) highlighting our research.

In June, they followed up with a ["1% Bonus Pledge Think Tank".](http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/events/1-bonus-pledge-think-tank) Hopefully more is to come. Suggestions welcome, of course.
