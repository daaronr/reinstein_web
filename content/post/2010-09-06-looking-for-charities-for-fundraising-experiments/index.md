We (myself and several colleagues in economics and psychology) are currently planning and running experiments  involving social influences on giving, reputation effects,  and commitments to give "bonus income". We may be able help you learn more about your donors, and improve your fundraising. If you think your organization might be interested in participating, please contact me at daaronr at essex.ac.uk.
