title: "Employee Giving incentives: A shared database... why?"

At innovationsinfundraising.org we've put together a (collaborative, living) [database](http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes) of information on what each of the firms in the FTSE100 do to encourage and support employee charitable giving.

- Do they 'match'  employee donations,  and if so what are the rules for this (caps, maximums, restrictions)?
- Do they have a '[Payroll Giving](https://www.gov.uk/payroll-giving)'  scheme set up, and if so who administers it,  and how do they promote it?
- Does the company endorse a particular charity or set of charities,  and if so how do they choose this?
-  What are the results... how much has been raised?

As far as we can see this is the first time this information has been made publicly available in a single place.  We will continue to improve and expand this as we learn more and people share information. Please peruse the sortable, filterable, searchable [table](http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes) , and click on individual firm entries (e.g., for [Rentokil Initial](http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=companies:rentokil_initial)).  Add your comments and questions in the discussion sections, or suggest a new entry (for a firm outside the FTSE100)  or a change using our [input form](https://airtable.com/shr4xbtZ26ykQF7qu).

 

**Why are we doing this, and whom is this for?**

_Ethically-minded job-seekers_ may want to consider this in deciding which company to work for.  For a larger donors (like someone taking the ['Giving what we Can'](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/)  pledge)  finding an employer who offers a generous donation-matching scheme will  bring a substantial direct benefit, allowing them to greatly magnify their impact.  In general,   companies that subsidise employee giving–and where many employees donate–may be more likely to have strong social values.

_Employees_ may not know about their own company's policies,  or may not have thought about taking advantage of these.

_Fundraisers and charities_ may find it fruitful to engage with firms with particularly generous employee-giving subsidies.

_Researchers and evaluators_ may use this as one measure of a firms' (and it's employees) pro-social orientation.  This information should also help enable researchers to find partner firms  interested in piloting and testing innovative fundraising programmes and initiatives.

_Advocates of effective altruism_ may find this a useful step towards understanding how companies choose which charities to support and endorse,  and how they might be persuaded to consider (more) impactful opportunities.

_CSR/HR_ departments may want to compare their own schemes and outcomes to those of their peers.
