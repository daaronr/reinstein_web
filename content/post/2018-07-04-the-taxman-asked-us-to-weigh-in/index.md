So, I'm weighing in. The Charity Tax Commission is having a ['call for evidence.'](https://www.ncvo.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/2183-charity-tax-commission-launches-public-call-for-evidence) I'm planning to submit the answers [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11trXY91ZEtjAM7OKjcjs0oTubysQQCBg7TYLXuEpqKE/edit#). This is a combination of my off-the-cuff insights, and elements drawn from research as discussed at innovationsinfundraising.org.

Please add comments -- tell me why I'm wrong.
