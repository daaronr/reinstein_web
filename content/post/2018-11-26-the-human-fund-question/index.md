_My thoughts:_ Yeah, I've wondered that myself. I suppose the _receiver_ of the gift has the right to be considered the 'giver of the charitable donation.' At least if it was in lieu of a birthday/wedding gift etc. Because they have 'sacrificed' their normal present for the charity.

The person who _gives_ this 'present' should not feel morally virtuous, and should certainly not reduce their other giving in response. (But perhaps the receiver could do so).

On the other hand if it's in honor of someone deceased or someone who isn't 'expecting' a gift, then the giver can feel virtuous. Agree?

On a related note, I often thought that one should be able to give _gift certificates_ to _purchase_ something at a charity store (Oxfam, etc). This is then a 'real gift' but also encourages the recipient to support the cause,
