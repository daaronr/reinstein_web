Large companies generously offer to support employee 'pro-bono' work and volunteer work, offering set-aside days and even donations matching hours; ([documented in my "innovationsinfundraising.org" database here](http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes)).  They are in general more willing to do this than to donate directly, or to match employee contributions.

However, there is often a [skills mismatch](https://www.ft.com/content/23ca4cf6-2b03-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca); few people can be as productive when volunteering for a charity as they are in their main job (although orgs like [BeyondMe](https://beyondme.org/) try to improve things). There are many skills that simply have little value in the charitable sector, or that are very company-specific.

Furthermore, most volunteering is _local_ by nature. In contrast, the charities that are most [effective](https://www.givewell.org/) at saving and improving lives and reducing poverty and suffering are working in poor countries.

But volunteering (rather than donating) is popular because it feels good and allows for "[virtue signaling](http://dp3021)" by individuals and companies. It is simply less socially acceptable to boast about one's donations than to say "whew, I'm so tired from a hard day serving soup to orphans".

## A proposed solution: the Corporate skills bake sale

Many people (myself included) and companies be hesitant to hire an expensive financial advisor, legal advisor, marketing analyst, web designer, process consultant, _luft gesheft_. There are a variety of reasons for this. I don't like the idea of money going into these deep pockets, I am deeply skeptical of the value provided, I may have pride in "doing it myself", and it may not be acceptable to my company to outsource this. The big-5 firms will never get this business. On the other hand, if I could get this service in exchange for making a _donation_, I might be willing to do it!

There are also particular services deemed [repugnant](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.21.3.37) or unfair; [see child.org's valet service for festival-goers](https://child.org/what-we-do). Again, you would feel icky paying a company for this, but you might feel OK doing it in exchange for a donation.

_Hence the **Corporate skills bake sale:**_ The employer offers its workers the opportunity to "volunteer" for a large "White List" of list of clients and organizations (or individuals), to provide the services in exchange for a set donation per-hour (or per-task) to the chosen charity. Presumably this will be below the usual billed rate, but still well above the value the employee would add through traditional volunteering.

For example (spitballing):

- A PWC auditor provides a day of expert guidance to a local construction firm, in exchange for an £800 donation to the Against Malaria Foundation
- An engineer at Google takes a three hour meeting high-level design advice to an idealistic startup in exchange for a $600 gift to GiveDirectly
- A KPMG partner offers pension fund advice, in a series of phone calls and emails, to a private university, in exchange for £2500 directed to the Fistula foundation

 

Compared to subsidizing "regular" volunteering, there are pros and cons

_Downsides and barriers include_

- Legal obstacles to allowing this (?),
- possible cannibalization of existing future revenue sources (if you choose  the wrong White List),
- and this may not be as inspiring/relaxing/solidarity-building as an activity like serving food to the homeless, building a house, or cleaning a park.

_There are also relative benefits to the firm, especially:_

- this may provide a foot-in-the-door to new clients,
- it may builds critical employee skills and help them discover new environments,
-  it may attract the highly-analytical and technically skilled cohort of [EA-motivated employees](http://eaworkplaceactivism.org/).
