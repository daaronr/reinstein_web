Talking about "Rational" versus "Irrational" behaviour or people ... it is not an either/or and "irrational" is a black box

The redundant term "Causal Effect"

\-- I'm against the use of the phrase "causal effect" or "causal impact" as this is completely redundant, and a bit _holier-than-thou_.  An "effect" of something is by definition "causal".  Just say "impact" or "effect".

Saying "External validity" as an either/or (I prefer "generalizability")

Saying "chickenburger" instead of "Chicken Hamburger"; Chocoholic instead of "chocolate addict" … etc.
