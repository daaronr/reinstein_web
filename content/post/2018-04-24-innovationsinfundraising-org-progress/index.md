Building [innovationsinfundraising.org](http://innovationsinfundraising.org) as a hub and wiki for researchers and practitioners trying to get a handle on the scientific _evidence_ on what motivates giving to the most effective charities. Collaboration (esp. in academia) can be difficult; it can work because we have a _shared interest_ in the impact and outcomes. We've just added a massive amount of content and organization: check out the "[tools page](http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=tools:tools)", for example, and please add your comments. You can suggest a new tool by filling out the form [HERE](https://airtable.com/shrPCL5M77QI6jNhz).  We will credit your contribution.
