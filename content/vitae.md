**Background:** I am an Economist with 25 years experience at UC Berkeley, the University of Essex and the [University of Exeter](http://business-school.exeter.ac.uk/about/people/profile/index.php?web_id=David_Reinstein), and in other consulting and teaching roles. My work involved performing [economic research](#pubs), [sharing research tools](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html), and disseminating and promoting the [impact of my research](#projects); as well as [teaching](#teaching) (at undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional/executive levels), research supervision, and educational administration and [entrepreneurship](#impact). I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkeley in 2006. I have [published a range of peer-reviewed research](#pubs) and done consulting and impact work involving behavioral economics, lab, field (A/B testing) and natural experimentation, panel-data econometrics and data science, game theory and mechanism design, and the practical applications of these. I am an active supporter of [open, robust, replicable and collaborative science](https://www.bitss.org/people/david-reinstein/), of the use of computer science and data science tools in Economics (e.g., [R-Markdown/Bookdown dynamic documents](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html)), and of [effective charitable giving](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/index.html).

<br>

*In 2021 I left my secure academic post:*

1. To pursue greater impact as a researcher at [Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/our-team), a think tank "dedicated to figuring out the best ways to make the world a better place." RP is closely tied to the [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) movement. My research into [effective charitable giving](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/index.html) is made possible by an independent grant.


2. To build tools and programs promoting open, collaborative, and robust  research, as well as teaching, learning, and research training outside of traditional university degree schemes.

<br>



**Research interests, work and goals**:


(i) the determinants and motivators of (effective) charitable giving,

(ii) measuring social, psychological, and  institutional influences on life choices and consumer behavior, and

(iii) building and measuring tools and policies aiming to improve social outcomes.

I combine microeconomic modeling, analysis of observational data, and field experiments and trials to bring evidence to a variety of interconnected questions, and provide tools for philanthropists, nonprofit organisations, governments, and managers.

I work to produce and encourage open and collaborative research, learning, and positive impact outside of traditional academic settings, and to share tools, skills, and insights from Economics, Psychology, Experimental Design, Statistics and Data Science.



<br>

**Education**: University of California at Berkeley, Ph.D., Economics (2006), supervisor: Professor Emmanuel Saez; George Washington University, B.S. Economics (1998)

**Research Interests**: Applied Econometrics and data analysis, Microeconomics, Public Economics, Other-regarding Behavior and Philanthropy, Psychology and Economics, Experimental Economics (lab and field), Economics of Education, Public Policy
