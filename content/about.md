**Dr. David Reinstein**

**Economics, social science, statistics, data science and field experiments, charitable giving and effective altruism, research and writing musings**


PhD (University of California, Berkeley, Economics)

[Senior Economist, Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/our-team) and Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Maastricht. Previous positions: Lecturer (University of Essex),  Senior Lecturer (Exeter University)

## My research and impact work focuses on

(i) **effective charitable giving and other-regarding behavior**,

- what motivates it (see [this synthesis](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/index.html)),
- particularly considering the impact of effectiveness information,
- and its impact.

(ii) measuring social, psychological, and institutional influences on life choices and consumer behavior, and

(iii) building and measuring tools and policies aiming to improve social outcomes.

I combine microeconomic modeling, analysis of observational data, and field experiments and trials to bring evidence to a variety of interconnected questions, and provide tools for philanthropists, nonprofit organisations, governments, and managers.

I work to produce and encourage open and collaborative research, learning, and positive impact outside of traditional settings.

## I published papers...

... in traditional academic journals such as the Journal of Public Economics,  Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, and Social Psychological and Personality Science. See [my CV](#pubs) for a full list. These include:

*Observational/causal econometrics*: [“The Influence of Expert Reviews ... A Case Study of Movie Critics” (2005)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4992942_The_Influence_of_Expert_Reviews_on_Consumer_Demand_for_Experience_Goods_A_Case_Study_of_Movie_Critics), [“Does One Contribution Come at the Expense of Another?...” (2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227377867_Does_One_Charitable_Contribution_Come_at_the_Expense_of_Another)

*Field and lab experiments*:  “Decomposing Desert and Tangibility Effects in a Charitable Giving Experiment” (2012),  [“Ex-ante Commitments to `Give if you Win’ Exceed Donations After a Win” (2018)](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/32001/GivingProbabilityMaster1_commentsout.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

*Applied microeconomic/behavioral theory:* [“Losing Face” (2018)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx4yfun1ctxuezw/LosingFace.pdf?dl=0), [“Anonymous Rituals” (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268111001806), [“Efficient Consumer Altruism and Fair Trade Products” (2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239768339_Efficient_Consumer_Altruism_and_Fair_Trade_Products)

## The new way

Peer review is great (and *peer evaluation* is better), but in the 2020's  we can do better than paying Elsevier&co to "publish" static pdfs for us. <!-- link to discussion/rant here --> I'm working to research/write/gain-critical-feedback in dynamic, collaborative, open/transparent, and continuously-updated formats.

Further discussion: See the ['unjournal' discussion](https://bit.ly/unjournal) and [project board](https://bit.ly/eaunjournal)

### Some of my work-in-progress in this mode:


<!-- Todo: put up at least one 'traditional research project in open format' here -->

<br>
*A broad project of synthesis and meta-analysis:* [Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://bit.ly/eg_barriers)

<br>
*Reporting on an experimental research project:* [Impact of impact treatments on giving: field experiments and synthesis](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/)



<br>

*Teaching/learning and research resource 'web books', and building and sharing knowledge and notes*

[Researching and writing for Economics students](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html),

[Microeconomics (MSc teaching)](https://daaronr.github.io/micro-giving-pub/)

[Statistics, econometrics, experiment and survey methods, data science: Notes (in progress)](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/introduction.html)

## Other projects and affiliations


*Impact project: Effective Altruism Market Testing team (EAMT)* [Public 'gitbook' action and reporting space](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/)

<br>

*Earlier outreach/impact project:* [Innovations in Fundraising](innovationsinfundraising.org)

<br>
*Ironically, I'm "humbled" by the honor of "winning" grants (so humbled that I feel compelled to announce it on my CV [here](https://daaronr.github.io/markdown-cv/))*
