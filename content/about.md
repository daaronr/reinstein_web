I work to produce and encourage open and collaborative research, learning, and positive impact outside of traditional settings. I focus on charitable giving and effectiveness, measuring social, psychological, and instituitional influences on life choices and consumer behavior. I combine microeconomic modeling, analysis of observational data, and field experiments and trials to bring evidence to a variety of interconnected questions, and build innovative policy and management tools.

**I published papers** in traditional academic journals (CV), such as...

*Observational/causal econometrics*: “The Influence of Expert Reviews on Consumer Demand for Experience Goods: A Case Study of Movie Critics” (Journal of Industrial Economics, 2005), “Does One Contribution Come at the Expense of Another? Empirical Evidence on Substitution Between Charitable Donations” (BEJEAP Advances, 2011)


*Field and lab experiments*:  “Decomposing Desert and Tangibility Effects in a Charitable Giving Experiment” (Exp. Econ., 2012),  “Ex-ante Commitments to `Give if you Win’ Exceed Donations After a Win” (Journal of Public Economics, 2018), 

*Applied micro and behavioral theory:* “Losing Face” (Oxford Economic Papers, 2018), “Anonymous Rituals” (JEBO, 2012), “Efficient Consumer Altruism and Fair Trade Products” (JEMS, 2012)

Peer review is great (and *peer evaluation* is better), but it's the 20's and we can do better than paying Elsevier & co to "publish" static pdfs for us. <!-- link to discussion/rant here --> I'm working to research/write/gain-critical-feedback in dynamic, collaborative, open/transparent, and continuously-updated formats:


<!-- Todo: put up at least one 'traditional research project in open format' here -->

*Ironically, I'm "humbled" by the following honors* 

- Grants from the British Academy to support ongoing experimental research into social influences on giving, a BA Mobility grant, and a Data Without Borders grant to use data from the Dutch educational lottery in connection with other administrative data.

David is a firm believer in public outreach of academic research. He is currently working on an ESRC funded Impact Cultivation project ‘Innovations in fundraising’, building links with fundraising professionals, charities and employers for collaboration and knowledge exchange [information on partnering here]. He has presented at a variety of academic and policy conferences, including  the British Academy Policy Centre [Video here], ISPRA ERC, and ESRC ‘Generosity and Well-Being’.
