**Economics, social science, statistics, data science and field experiments, charitable giving and effective altruism, research and writing musings**


PhD (University of California, Berkeley, Economics) 

[Senior Economist, Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/our-team) and Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Maastricht. Previous positions: Lecturer (University of Essex),  Senior Lecturer (Exeter University)

## My research and impact work focuses on

(i) the determinants and motivators of (effective) charitable giving,

(ii) measuring social, psychological, and institutional influences on life choices and consumer behavior, and

(iii) building and measuring tools and policies aiming to improve social outcomes. 

I combine microeconomic modeling, analysis of observational data, and field experiments and trials to bring evidence to a variety of interconnected questions, and provide tools for philanthropists, nonprofit organisations, governments, and managers.

I work to produce and encourage open and collaborative research, learning, and positive impact outside of traditional settings.

## I published papers... 

... in traditional academic journals such as the Journal of Public Economics,  Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, and Social Psychological and Personality Science. See [my CV](#pubs) for a full list. These include: 

*Observational/causal econometrics*: [“The Influence of Expert Reviews ... A Case Study of Movie Critics” (2005)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4992942_The_Influence_of_Expert_Reviews_on_Consumer_Demand_for_Experience_Goods_A_Case_Study_of_Movie_Critics), [“Does One Contribution Come at the Expense of Another?...” (2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227377867_Does_One_Charitable_Contribution_Come_at_the_Expense_of_Another)

*Field and lab experiments*:  “Decomposing Desert and Tangibility Effects in a Charitable Giving Experiment” (2012),  [“Ex-ante Commitments to `Give if you Win’ Exceed Donations After a Win” (2018)](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/32001/GivingProbabilityMaster1_commentsout.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) 

*Applied microeconomic/behavioral theory:* [“Losing Face” (2018)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx4yfun1ctxuezw/LosingFace.pdf?dl=0), [“Anonymous Rituals” (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268111001806), [“Efficient Consumer Altruism and Fair Trade Products” (2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239768339_Efficient_Consumer_Altruism_and_Fair_Trade_Products)

## The new way

Peer review is great (and *peer evaluation* is better), but in the 2020's  we can do better than paying Elsevier&co to "publish" static pdfs for us. <!-- link to discussion/rant here --> I'm working to research/write/gain-critical-feedback in dynamic, collaborative, open/transparent, and continuously-updated formats. 

Further discussion: See the ['unjournal' discussion](https://bit.ly/unjournal) and [project board](https://bit.ly/eaunjournal)

### Some of my work-in-progress in this mode:


<!-- Todo: put up at least one 'traditional research project in open format' here -->

<br> 
*A broad project of synthesis and meta-analysis:* [Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://bit.ly/eg_barriers)

<br> 
*Reporting on an experimental research project project:* [Impact of impact treatments on giving: field experiments and synthesis](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/)


<br> 

*An outreach/impact project:* [Innovations in Fundraising](innovationsinfundraising.org) 

<br> 

*Teaching/learning and research resource 'web books', and building and sharing knowledge and notes*

[Researching and writing for Economics students](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html),

[Microeconomics (MSc teaching)](https://daaronr.github.io/micro-giving-pub/)

## Other projects and affiliations

*Ironically, I'm "humbled" by the honor of "winning" grants (so humbled that I feel compelled to announce it on my CV [here](https://daaronr.github.io/markdown-cv/))*
