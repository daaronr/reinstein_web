# Effective Altruism: Research Priorities and Opportunities

## Know this


![We can now do better than this vague hope!](https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-practical-men-who-believe-themselves-to-be-quite-exempt-from-any-intellectual-influence-john-maynard-keynes-39-75-16.jpg)


The founders of Effective Altruism took ideas from Philosophy, Economics, and other parts of academia to build a rigorous approach to 'doing the most good in the world', and to exploring and measuring this. 

Miraculously, EA also has a passionate and influential group of supporters, and a substantial pool of funds for research, interventions, and advocacy!

EA and global priorities research offers a huge opportunity for academic researchers to have an positive impact (on the allocation of funds, and on the market of ideas).

There are opportunities for funding to support your research within academia, to promote the impact of your research (and gain valuable feedback), and/or you may want to leave academia work directly for an EA-aligned organization (like I did).




## My story


My experience and advice


From my [web CV](https://daaronr.github.io/markdown-cv/) ...


> Background: I am an Economist with 25 years experience at UC Berkeley, the University of Essex and the University of Exeter, and in other consulting and teaching roles. My work involved performing economic research, sharing research tools, and disseminating and promoting the impact of my research; as well as teaching (at undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional/executive levels), research supervision, and educational administration and entrepreneurship. I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkeley in 2006. I have published a range of peer-reviewed research and done consulting and impact work involving behavioral economics, lab, field (A/B testing) and natural experimentation, panel-data econometrics and data science, game theory and mechanism design, and the practical applications of these. I am an active supporter of open, robust, replicable and collaborative science, of the use of computer science and data science tools in Economics (e.g., R-Markdown/Bookdown dynamic documents), and of effective charitable giving.



Berkeley:

- Proposing 'new ideas' like the Poor Card

- Considering ideas with a pre-EA policy audience
    - 'Does one donation come at the expense of another'?
    - Should an 'efficient altruist' purchase 'fair trade' products, bundling consumer choices with additional revenue to poor farmers/workers?

Limited audience: 'How does this inform *government* policy?', 'How does it inform/relate to standard Economics (tractable mathematical) models of optimization?', 'Will this publish well'?
\


Essex, UK:

- Experiments/trials and observational work on charitable and gift-giving:  social influences, types of income/uncertainty

- Applied microeconomic theory:

\

Moved to Exeter, UK 

- to pursue 'Impact' (ESRC grant, REF focus)

- building teaching/research/outreach resources, such as
    - innovationsinfundraising.org and 'barriers to effective giving'
    - “Researching and writing for Economics students”


- Positives: A fairly supportive environment, research freedom,  many great colleagues, moderate teaching
- Limitations: academic politics and poor upper-management, countervailing rewards system, constant discussion of points/games

Note: UK academia rewards either 'REF-points publications', box-ticking accreditations, or currying favor with deans

> In 2021 I left my secure academic post:

> To pursue greater impact as a researcher at Rethink Priorities, a think tank “dedicated to figuring out the best ways to make the world a better place.” RP is closely tied to the Effective Altruism movement. My research into effective charitable giving is made possible by a grant from Pan Pan Wong under the advising of Longview Philanthropy.

> To build tools and programs promoting open, collaborative, and robust research, as well as teaching, learning, and research training outside of traditional university degree schemes.


### Limitations of Academia


- my academic career and research interests; sometimes lack of interest in
    - 'implications for rational altruists'
    - collaborative open-source projects that didn't have a standard 'publication outcome'
- Why I transitioned to work at RP and what it's like

Will return to this at the end


## ‘What is EA’ (brief, research-focused)

- Doing the ‘most good’ given limited resources (some relationship to utilitarianism)... but how do we define this?

- The ITN framework


## What are the ‘important cause areas’?

## EA perspectives:  Why do we need research, what should research do?


Defining a moral framework and ‘what has value’ (moral weights, population ethics, moral uncertainty etc)

Empirical measurement of

- ‘What has value?’ (e.g., sentience research)

- How to achieve value? (direct interventions and policies)

- How to get people and institutions to care about others (altruism) and about being effective in doing so?



Operationalizing:

‘Which research to prioritize’?

’How to measure research impact?



How research in EA differs from research in academia (motivations, how success is measured)

Changing the game: Ideas for more productive system of peer feedback and credibility
The EA research landscape - a new ‘funder’ and consumer of research
Brief on RP and what we do,
other research institutes in this space (GPI, FHI, GiveWell-ish, Open Phil internal, who else?)
Opportunities for academics and students (including career paths/RP job openings), funding sources
My own research: motivating effective giving and prosocial behavior, experiments and meta-analysis
(Perhaps also mention the Effective Thesis project?)
I don’t really have a sense of who the audience is … will try to look this up … seems like mainly academics (edited)


## How can academics support and do EA/GP research within universities

- Topics
- Approach
- Contact with EA organisations and support opportunities
- Help build open-content
- Work with students and with Effective Thesis

### Who should want to work at an EA org? Why or why not?

Note: RP and GPI differ dramatically in focus and approach; I'm mainly talking about RP

Yes

- Care about impact and social good; research outcomes, implications, applications

- Rigorous analytical framework (Philosophy, Economics, Statistics/data) *anchored and connected to the practical*

- "Interdisciplinary" in the right way

- Positive environment: people motivated by *outcomes*, zero competitiveness/politics AFAIK

- High-achieving, super-literate and 'switched on' colleagues

No
