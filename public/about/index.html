    <p>David Reinstein’s research considers altruism, charitable giving, social and psychological influences, life choices, and consumer behavior. His work combines economic modeling, analysis of observational data, and lab and field experiments to answer a variety of interconnected questions, and build innovative policy and management tools.</p>
<p>These topics are examined in  “The Influence of Expert Reviews on Consumer Demand for Experience Goods: A Case Study of Movie Critics” (Journal of Industrial Economics, 2005), in “Efficient Consumer Altruism and Fair Trade Products” (JEMS, 2012), in “Anonymous Rituals” (JEBO, 2012), in “Does One Contribution Come at the Expense of Another? Empirical Evidence on Substitution Between Charitable Donations” (BEJEAP Advances, 2011), in “Decomposing Desert and Tangibility Effects in a Charitable Giving Experiment” (Exp. Econ., 2012),   in “Reputation and Influence in Charitable Giving: An Experiment” (Theory and Decision, 2012), “Ex-ante Commitments to `Give if you Win’ Exceed Donations After a Win” (Journal of Public Economics, 2018), and “Losing Face” (Oxford Economic Papers, 2018).</p>
<p>Dr David Reinstein is a Senior Lecturer  (US equivalent: Assistant/Assoc. Professor) at the University of Exeter. He currently teaches Economic Analysis and Policy.</p>
<p>Recent honors include two generous grants from the British Academy to support ongoing experimental research into social influences on giving, a BA Mobility grant, and a Data Without Borders grant to use data from the Dutch educational lottery in connection with other administrative data.</p>
<p>David is a firm believer in public outreach of academic research. He is currently working on an ESRC funded Impact Cultivation project ‘Innovations in fundraising’, building links with fundraising professionals, charities and employers for collaboration and knowledge exchange [information on partnering here]. He has presented at a variety of academic and policy conferences, including  the British Academy Policy Centre [Video here], ISPRA ERC, and ESRC ‘Generosity and Well-Being’.</p>
