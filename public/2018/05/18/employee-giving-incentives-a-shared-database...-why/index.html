    <p>At innovationsinfundraising.org we&rsquo;ve put together a (collaborative, living) <a href="http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes">database</a> of information on what each of the firms in the FTSE100 do to encourage and support employee charitable giving.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they &lsquo;match&rsquo;  employee donations,  and if so what are the rules for this (caps, maximums, restrictions)?</li>
<li>Do they have a &lsquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-giving">Payroll Giving</a>&rsquo;  scheme set up, and if so who administers it,  and how do they promote it?</li>
<li>Does the company endorse a particular charity or set of charities,  and if so how do they choose this?</li>
<li> What are the results&hellip; how much has been raised?</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as we can see this is the first time this information has been made publicly available in a single place.  We will continue to improve and expand this as we learn more and people share information. Please peruse the sortable, filterable, searchable <a href="http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes">table</a> , and click on individual firm entries (e.g., for <a href="http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=companies:rentokil_initial">Rentokil Initial</a>).  Add your comments and questions in the discussion sections, or suggest a new entry (for a firm outside the FTSE100)  or a change using our <a href="https://airtable.com/shr4xbtZ26ykQF7qu">input form</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are we doing this, and whom is this for?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ethically-minded job-seekers</em> may want to consider this in deciding which company to work for.  For a larger donors (like someone taking the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">&lsquo;Giving what we Can&rsquo;</a>  pledge)  finding an employer who offers a generous donation-matching scheme will  bring a substantial direct benefit, allowing them to greatly magnify their impact.  In general,   companies that subsidise employee giving–and where many employees donate–may be more likely to have strong social values.</p>
<p><em>Employees</em> may not know about their own company&rsquo;s policies,  or may not have thought about taking advantage of these.</p>
<p><em>Fundraisers and charities</em> may find it fruitful to engage with firms with particularly generous employee-giving subsidies.</p>
<p><em>Researchers and evaluators</em> may use this as one measure of a firms' (and it&rsquo;s employees) pro-social orientation.  This information should also help enable researchers to find partner firms  interested in piloting and testing innovative fundraising programmes and initiatives.</p>
<p><em>Advocates of effective altruism</em> may find this a useful step towards understanding how companies choose which charities to support and endorse,  and how they might be persuaded to consider (more) impactful opportunities.</p>
<p><em>CSR/HR</em> departments may want to compare their own schemes and outcomes to those of their peers.</p>
