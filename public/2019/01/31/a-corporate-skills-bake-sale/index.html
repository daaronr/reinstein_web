    <p>Large companies generously offer to support employee &lsquo;pro-bono&rsquo; work and volunteer work, offering set-aside days and even donations matching hours; (<a href="http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes">documented in my &ldquo;innovationsinfundraising.org&rdquo; database here</a>).  They are in general more willing to do this than to donate directly, or to match employee contributions.</p>
<p>However, there is often a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/23ca4cf6-2b03-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca">skills mismatch</a>; few people can be as productive when volunteering for a charity as they are in their main job (although orgs like <a href="https://beyondme.org/">BeyondMe</a> try to improve things). There are many skills that simply have little value in the charitable sector, or that are very company-specific.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most volunteering is <em>local</em> by nature. In contrast, the charities that are most <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">effective</a> at saving and improving lives and reducing poverty and suffering are working in poor countries.</p>
<p>But volunteering (rather than donating) is popular because it feels good and allows for &ldquo;<a href="http://dp3021">virtue signaling</a>&rdquo; by individuals and companies. It is simply less socially acceptable to boast about one&rsquo;s donations than to say &ldquo;whew, I&rsquo;m so tired from a hard day serving soup to orphans&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="a-proposed-solution-the-corporate-skills-bake-sale">A proposed solution: the Corporate skills bake sale</h2>
<p>Many people (myself included) and companies be hesitant to hire an expensive financial advisor, legal advisor, marketing analyst, web designer, process consultant, <em>luft gesheft</em>. There are a variety of reasons for this. I don&rsquo;t like the idea of money going into these deep pockets, I am deeply skeptical of the value provided, I may have pride in &ldquo;doing it myself&rdquo;, and it may not be acceptable to my company to outsource this. The big-5 firms will never get this business. On the other hand, if I could get this service in exchange for making a <em>donation</em>, I might be willing to do it!</p>
<p>There are also particular services deemed <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.21.3.37">repugnant</a> or unfair; <a href="https://child.org/what-we-do">see child.org&rsquo;s valet service for festival-goers</a>. Again, you would feel icky paying a company for this, but you might feel OK doing it in exchange for a donation.</p>
<p><em>Hence the <strong>Corporate skills bake sale:</strong></em> The employer offers its workers the opportunity to &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; for a large &ldquo;White List&rdquo; of list of clients and organizations (or individuals), to provide the services in exchange for a set donation per-hour (or per-task) to the chosen charity. Presumably this will be below the usual billed rate, but still well above the value the employee would add through traditional volunteering.</p>
<p>For example (spitballing):</p>
<ul>
<li>A PWC auditor provides a day of expert guidance to a local construction firm, in exchange for an £800 donation to the Against Malaria Foundation</li>
<li>An engineer at Google takes a three hour meeting high-level design advice to an idealistic startup in exchange for a $600 gift to GiveDirectly</li>
<li>A KPMG partner offers pension fund advice, in a series of phone calls and emails, to a private university, in exchange for £2500 directed to the Fistula foundation</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Compared to subsidizing &ldquo;regular&rdquo; volunteering, there are pros and cons</p>
<p><em>Downsides and barriers include</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Legal obstacles to allowing this (?),</li>
<li>possible cannibalization of existing future revenue sources (if you choose  the wrong White List),</li>
<li>and this may not be as inspiring/relaxing/solidarity-building as an activity like serving food to the homeless, building a house, or cleaning a park.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are also relative benefits to the firm, especially:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>this may provide a foot-in-the-door to new clients,</li>
<li>it may builds critical employee skills and help them discover new environments,</li>
<li> it may attract the highly-analytical and technically skilled cohort of <a href="http://eaworkplaceactivism.org/">EA-motivated employees</a>.</li>
</ul>
